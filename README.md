## Development

Before working on the code, if you plan to contribute your changes, you need to read the Chef Contributing document.

<https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>

You will also need to set up the repository with the appropriate branches. We document the process on the Chef Wiki.

Once your repository is set up, you can start working on the code.
